:data file format:
see data_to_read.dat file
#now we tolerate multi newlines
# >1 newlines between series.
# >=0 newlines at the begin of file.
# >=0 newlines at the end of file.
#all X values are the same, across different series.
#all metric names are the same, across different series.
#unit name is optional, both "Metric3(unit3)" and "Metric3" are acceptable.
#UPDATE:now it support series of different number of x points.
#series label can be 'null', if there is only one series.
#UPDATE: now it support error bar
#if a column is with err, the null value must be appended (with |) with sth! 

:pyplot.py configuration:
configurable_scaling: how many x tick marks among which one get shown the value?
